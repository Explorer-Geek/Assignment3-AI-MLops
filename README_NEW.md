At present in software industry, DevOps and DataOps have been adopted as essential methodologies to improve quality and reduce the release timeline of software engineering and data engineering initiatives. Due to the pervasiveness nature of internet connectivity across the world, there has been rapid growth in machine learning (ML) systems. This rapid exponential growth  demands development of similar approaches in the context of ML engineering, which handle the unique complexities of the practical applications of ML. This is the domain of MLOps. MLOps is a set of standardized processes and technology capabilities for building, deploying, and operationalizing ML systems rapidly and reliably.

MLOps is modeled on DevOps, the existing practice of more efficiently writing, deploying, and managing enterprise applications. DevOps began as a way to unite software developers (the Devs) and IT operations teams (the Ops), destroying data silos and enabling better collaboration. MLOps shares these aims but adds data scientists and ML engineers to the team. Data scientists curate datasets and analyze them by creating AI models for them. ML engineers are the people who use automated, disciplined processes to run the datasets through the models.

MLOps takes the DevOps application lifecycle and lays out a similar lifecycle for ML model development, which consists of gathering and preparing data, designing and training a model, then evaluating and releasing that model. 

DevOps Vs DataOps Vs MLOps:

First, we must start with what developers do when developing an application. Typically, you first code the app, then test it by writing some unit tests and integration tests, followed by deployment, and finally you monitor it to see if there are any issues. Whether using waterfall or agile, the overall steps are the same, just iterated more frequently. Over the years, this has become DevOps by adding automation to the coding, building CI/CD pipelines to automatically build the app and run the tests when a pull request is created. DevOps practices traditionally apply to the end-to-end lifecycle of developing applications.

DataOps is simply applying DevOps to data instead of an application or traditional code. DataOps is managing the whole data lifecycle, from creation to deployment to monitoring that data. Similarly, MLOps applies DevOps principles but to machine learning models, which are like applications but requiring training, running interference, and verifying that the results are accurate. Both DataOps and MLOps are DevOps-driven.

AIOps includes DataOps and MLOps. Because AI needs to have data coming in, such as logs or metrics, and that data needs to be managed in terms of the lifecycle to check the accuracy and right stats, AIOps uses DataOps. Because AI is driven by machine learning models and it needs machine learning models to be created, deployed, trained, and analyzed to see if the results are accurate, AIOps includes MLOps as well. DevOps is used in AIOps for lifecycle management and automation of all the applications that comprise the AIOps. And, finally, AIOps can be used to further optimize and make better decisions along the software development lifecycle of DataOps, MLOps and DevOps. In summary, AIOps uses these Ops, and AIOps can also be applied inside each of these Ops.


MLOps can assist organizations in many ways:

Scaling:

MLOps is critical to scaling an organization’s number of machine learning-driven applications.

Trust:
MLOps also builds trust for managing machine learning in dynamic environments by creating a repeatable process through automation, testing, and validation. 
MLOps enhances the reliability, credibility, and productivity of ML development.

Seamless integration, improved communication. Similar to DevOps, MLOps follows a pattern of practices that aim to integrate the development cycle and the operations process seamlessly. Typically, the data science team has a deep understanding of the data, while the operations team holds the business acumen. 

MLOps enhances ML efficiency by combining the expertise of each team, leveraging both skill sets. The enhanced collaboration and more appropriate division of expertise for data and operations teams established by MLOps reduces the bottleneck produced by non-intuitive, complex algorithms. MLOps systems create adaptable, dynamic machine learning production pipelines that flex to accommodate KPI-driven models.

Better use of data. MLOps can also radically change how businesses manage and capitalize on big data. By improving products with each iteration, MLOps shortens production life cycles, driving reliable insights that can be used more rapidly. MLOps also enables more focused feedback by helping to decipher what is just noise and which anomalies demand attention.

Compliance: The regulatory and compliance piece of operations is an increasingly important function, particularly as ML becomes more common. Regulations such as the Algorithmic Accountability Bill in New York City and the GDPR in the EU highlight the increasing stringency of machine learning regulations. MLOps keeps your team at the forefront of best practices and evolving law. MLOps systems can reproduce models in accordance and compliance with original standards to ensure your system stays in compliance even as consequent models and machine learning pipelines evolve. Your data team can focus on creating and deploying models knowing the operations team has ownership of regulatory processes.

Reduced risk and bias:

Business risk via undermined or lost consumer trust can be the result of unreliable, inaccurate models. Unfortunately, training data and the volatile, complex data of real world conditions may be drastically different, leading models to make poor quality predictions. This renders them liabilities rather than assets; MLOps reduces this risk. Additionally, MLOps can help prevent some development biases—including some that can lead to missed opportunities, underrepresented audiences, or legal risk. Many, if not most, current machine learning deployment processes are complex, manual, and cross-disciplinary, touching business, data science, and IT. This makes quick detection and resolution of model performance problems a challenge.
